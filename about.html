          <p>Outdoor Advertising Magazine said that outdoor mobile media billboards have a 97%
            recall rate, and 99% of survey respondents thought mobile advertising is more effective
            than traditional outdoor advertising.
          </p>
          <p>Selit is the first of its kind of mobile advertising company that uses ridesharing cars
            for advertising. We operate in the highly dense city of San Francisco and across the Bay
            Area giving your product the high exposure it needs. You can choose us to advertise for
            any kind of business. Whether you want a hundred cars or a massive fleet on the road we
            can make it happen. 
          </p>
          <p>Choosing us is a the most cost effective way to get guaranteed
            returns on your investment compared to using any other advertising outlet in the market.
            And the best part, we have the technology to monitor where and how many hours your ad
            has been on on the road making sure not even one of your penny is going to waste.
