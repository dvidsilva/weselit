          <p>Outdoor Advertising Magazine said that outdoor mobile media billboards have a 97%
            recall rate, and 99% of survey respondents thought mobile advertising is more effective
            than traditional outdoor advertising.
          </p>
          <p>Selit is the first of its kind. A <strong>mobile
             advertising</strong> company that uses ride-sharing cars for
            advertising. We operate in the highly dense city of San Francisco
            and across the Bay Area giving your product the high exposure it
            needs. You can choose us to advertise for any kind of business.
            Whether you want a hundred cars or a massive fleet on the road we
            can make it happen.
          </p>
          <p>Choosing us is the most <strong>cost effective</strong> way to get
            guaranteed <strong>returns</strong> on your investment compared to
            using any other advertising outlet in the market. And to do just
            that, we have the technology to monitor where and how many hours
            your ad has been on the road.  </p>

                  look that much more attractive and creates curiosity in both
                  the riders and the people that see it on the street. Picture
                  200 rideÂ­sharing cars posting ads of your product and
                  driving in the city of San Francisco, the buzz it will create
                  and all the impression it will make. Be the first one, and get
                  all the heat that comes with it.</p>

                <p>Unlike other mobile advertisements that just post ads and
                  drive around the city, our drivers will happily assist in
                  promoting your product. While bringing positive image to your
                  product, drivers will take a larger percentage of the
                  revenue. Especially in this time where there are big cuts in
                  fare prices which creates financial burden on ride-share
                  drivers. Your company name can be the answer.

                <p>We are working with individual contractors who are growing
                  at an exponential rate. There is a little over 15,000 Uber
                  drivers in San Francisco according to the Washington Post.
                  They predict this number is going to double by the beginning
                  of next year. This allows us to have a large number of
                  vehicles available for ads. In an untapped market.
