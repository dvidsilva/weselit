            <p>There will be a retainer fee in both cases. Option A would cost less in terms of the retainer the
              advertising company would have to pay, because we won’t be responsible for the printing of the
              stickers. The initial retainer should be received 30 days before the launch of the campaign. The
              retainer will include the entire amount our company will spend on installation and/ or printing.
              The retainer amount will be $10,000 for every 100 cars for printing and installation</p>
            <p><strong>Specifics of Stickers</strong>: All our stickers are going to be no bigger than 2 feet by 4 feet. They are
              going to be stuck on both sides of the car. They will be covering both front and back doors of the
              car. These specification will be a fit for any uber x vehicle. The adhesive the stickers will have is
              called 3M. This adhesive makes the installation and removal of the sticker very easy. It also can
              be removed at any time without causing any damage to the vehicle or its paint.</p>
